The sun beat down on Dick, baking the coral ledge beneath his feet.  The roar of the ocean – a furious beast crashing against the outer reef – was a counterpoint to the serene, sapphire stillness of Karolin lagoon, stretching before him like a limitless, turquoise dream. Gulls wheeled lazily overhead, their cries lost in the vastness. This tranquil expanse, ringed by forty miles of protective coral, was *his*.  His, since yesterday.  His, by the sheer, improbable grace of fate.

His gaze swept across the vibrant beach: women weaving intricate paraka patches, children shrieking with laughter as they played, fishermen hauling in their nets.  All of them, his people now.  His canoes, pulled high on the sand. His empty houses, once echoing with the rhythmic thrum of war canoes.

But a shadow crossed his face.  His brow furrowed as he shifted his gaze from the peaceful lagoon to the menacing thunder of the northern sea. Beyond that turbulent horizon, invisible yet ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree – a paradise veiled in shadow, a jewel tainted with the poison of savagery.

Little Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker's son, sat nearby, his innocent eyes fixed on Dick.  Tari, a child who knew only the emptiness left by war, the absence of men, the vulnerability of women and children.  Yesterday, from the northern sea, a strange boat had arrived, carrying Dick and Katafa – the girl lost to the sea years before, returned like a miracle.  The women whispered of gods and divine intervention; Tari, in his guileless way, cut straight to the heart of the matter.

"Taori," he asked, his voice a soft ripple in the ocean breeze, "who *are* you?"

The question hung in the air, a shimmering veil between two worlds.  Dick could have told him the truth – a tale of a boyhood spent on Palm Tree with an old sailor named Kearney, a life of stolen moments and whispered secrets, the harsh reality of Melanesian raiders, the desperate escape in a battered dinghy… but the words stuck in his throat.  The name “Dick Lestrange” felt as distant as a forgotten dream.  The past, etched in the fading lines of memory, was a hazy canvas, its details blurred by sun and sea and sorrow.  Only his life with Katafa, since Kearney's passing, burned bright and clear.

He knelt, looking into the child's trusting eyes. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

Tari, already distracted by the joyous shrieks of children hauling in a net, forgot his question as easily as he’d asked it.  But the seed of curiosity had been planted.  Dick's gaze returned to the north, and the schooner, consumed by flames, rose before his eyes.  He saw himself and Katafa, fleeing for their lives, the relentless pursuit echoing in his ears.  He saw their arrival on this beach, the hopeful faces of the islanders… but the memory of the brutal Melanesians, the burning ship, the fear etched on Katafa's face, stained the idyllic scene with darkness.

They were gone, but they would return.  They would build canoes, they would see the shimmering reflection of the lagoon in the northern sky, and they would come.  Dick, a kanaka, a savage in the eyes of the world, yet possessed of a white man's strategic mind, knew this.  He’d already sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – master canoe-builders – to prepare for the inevitable.

A hand settled on his shoulder.  Katafa.  A stray lock of her raven hair danced in the breeze, mirroring the turmoil in her eyes, fixed on the hazy point on the horizon.

"Look," she whispered.

Palm Tree, shimmering through the mirage, materialized slowly from the sea-dazzle: a ghostly vision, beautiful and terrifying at once.  The horrors of the past – the monstrous figures, the smell of rum and blood, the screams – were superimposed on that idyllic image, a chilling reminder of the danger that still lurked.  They had threatened him, yes, but they had threatened Katafa, and *that* was unbearable.

The vision faded, replaced by the image of a canoe approaching from the south. The canoe builders were coming.  As they walked toward them, the threat of Palm Tree remained, a shadow in the sunlight, a promise of future conflict. The war canoes would be built. The fight for survival, for Katafa, had begun.
